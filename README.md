##The Climate Change Twitter Presentation

We selected this topic because we were interested in learning how a change in temperature in your location affects your sentiment towards climate change.

The data is sourced from Twitter tweets from 2006-2011. The original data set has 1,048,576 rows. The columns are ‘created at’, ‘id’, ‘lat’, ‘lng’, ‘topic’, ‘sentiment’, ‘stance’, ‘gender’, ‘temperature change’, and ‘aggressiveness’. The data consists of categorical and numerical data and has some null values in certain columns, particularly the ‘lat’, ‘lng’, and ‘temperature change’ columns. The columns of particular interest for us in this analysis are the ‘sentiment’, ‘stance’, and ‘temperature change’ to find a correlation (if any) between these variables.

We want to know whether people who are in areas that have experienced higher degrees of climate change are more likely to believe in climate change. We also want to know whether gender as well as where you are located will have a large impact on the sentiment and belief in climate change. These are the three main questions that we are looking to answer with our machine learning model.
